# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
#   Build at 00:00 on every 15th day-of-month.
#   schedule:
#     - cron: "0 0 */15 * *"
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
